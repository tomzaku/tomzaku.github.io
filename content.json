I want to keep my emotion, feeling my trip in Blog. And it’s memorable, dangerous ever. 20 November, 2015. My Unbelievable birthday ever. Yesterday, I decided traveling to Lao Bao from Hue city. There’re 2 way from Hue City to Lao Bao: One is QL1A street and the rest is HCM street. So I make the rule “Don’t go the same way”. That mean morning i came at QL1A street and came back at HCM street. The story is not easy in this way. I started at 9:00 am from Hue city with a niece (3 years old), a sister-in-law, a friend. We had 4 people traveling to Lao Bao. Like I said, I biked at QL1A first, It’s so easy to handling. The street was a good and wide. The sky was so clear, and sunny day. I finished Lao Bao city at 1pm. I had lunch at 12pm. It far from Lao Bao 11 km. So we decided go market until 2:30 pm. And we came back home. But I decided go another way. HCM Street, I want to discover the scenery and people live here. But I don’t care it was bad choose when I selected. The story began at that time. We just come home with free soul, comfortable and funny talk. Take a picker, recording video of scenery. So fantastic, The scenery have more that I expect: stream, mountain, bird, people live here. They’s mixing together generate peace of place. I was deep in this solution until I realized the sky was covering dark.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"story","slug":"story","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/story/"}],"keywords":[]},{"title":"How can I write a good CV","slug":"writing-cv","date":"2016-11-18T01:24:46.000Z","updated":"2016-12-15T06:16:08.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/18/writing-cv/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/18/writing-cv/","excerpt":"","text":"My story:I took part in Apollo class on October,2016 .
